This directory contains functions currently or previously available in
core Octave. Of these functions, only those not present in the local
Octave version will be installed by the package. Under this directory:

Only statistics functions available in some core Octave versions
should be added. (Functions with different names than (former) core
Octave functions should be placed under inst/ .)

If functions are added, they should also be added to the file
utils/functions_to_install.

Newer function versions than contained in core Octave can be
developed, but this should only be done for functions removed (or
scheduled for removal) from core Octave.
